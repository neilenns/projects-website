## Configuring a station volume action

The station volume action displays the current volume of a specific station and enables changing the volume, as well as muting
the station. This action requires a dial control, available on the [Stream Deck +](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-plus-black).

Turning the knob will adjust the station volume. Pressing the knob will toggle mute
for the station.
