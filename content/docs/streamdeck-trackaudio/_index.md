title: TrackAudio actions for Stream Deck
---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin requires [TrackAudio beta 1.3.0-beta.1](https://github.com/pierr3/TrackAudio/releases/tag/1.3.0-beta.1) or later. It will not work with earlier versions of TrackAudio.

This Stream Deck plugin provides actions to interact with TrackAudio. [Get the plugin from the Elgato marketplace](https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/trackaudio-e913a0ca-4c12-411d-a5a6-acf5f6c4bdea). Need inspiration for how to use these actions? Check out the [examples](#examples) section.

Do you use [vATIS](https://vatis.app/) when controlling? Check out the [vATIS actions for Stream Deck plugin](https://github.com/neilenns/streamdeck-vatis).

## Action descriptions

| Action            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ATIS letter       | Shows the current ATIS letter for a specific station. If you are controlling with [vATIS](https://vatis.app/) use the [vATIS actions for Stream Deck plugin](https://github.com/neilenns/streamdeck-vatis) instead of this action. |
| Hotline           | Switches active TX between two stations, typically a primary controlling position and a secondary hotline position.                                                                                                                |
| Push to talk      | Triggers TX on all TX frequencies, as if pressing the push to talk key configured in TrackAudio.                                                                                                                                   |
| Station status    | Shows the current RX, TX, or XCA for a specific station. Pressing the action toggles specified state for that station. Also shows the last received callsign by the station.                                                       |
| TrackAudio status | Shows the current state of the connection to TrackAudio from Stream Deck and whether TrackAudio is voice connected to VATSIM.                                                                                                      |

After installation the plugin actions are available under the TrackAudio category:

## Configuring a station status action

The station status action displays the current status of a single station's button in TrackAudio, including
whether communication is currently active. It also automatically adds the station to TrackAudio after
a voice connection is established.

Pressing the action will either toggle the equivalent button in TrackAudio or mute the station's audio.
A long press of the action will refresh the action's state.

For example, if you are controlling `LMT_TWR` and have TrackAudio set up like this:

![Screenshot of the LMT_TWR station position configured in TrackAudio for receive (RX), transmit (TX), and cross-couple across (XCA)](images/trackAudio.png)

configure the station status action like this to show that RX is enabled and the last received callsign:

![Screenshot of a station status button configuration, with callsign set to LMT_TWR, RX selected, and show last receive callsign enabled](images/station-status.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The action lights up when transmissions occur on the _frequency_ of the callsign. This means if two stations share the same frequency (e.g. `PDX_GND` and `GEG_GND`) the action will light up when transmissions happen on either of those stations.

## Configuring a station volume action

The station volume action displays the current volume of a specific station and enables changing the volume, as well as muting
the station. This action requires a dial control, available on the [Stream Deck +](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-plus-black).

Turning the knob will adjust the station volume. Pressing the knob will toggle mute
for the station.

| Not muted     | The image to display when the station is not muted in TrackAudio. Optional, defaults to a volume icon.  |         |
| Unavailable   | The image to display when the station is not added in TrackAudio. Optional, defaults to a warning icon. |         |

## Configuring a hotline action

The hotline action provides a quick way to toggle between two stations for voice transmissions. This is typically
used by center controllers who have a hotline frequency established with neighbouring sectors.
It also automatically adds the primary and hotline stations to TrackAudio after a voice connection is established.

To use the hotline action start by adding the appropriate stations to TrackAudio. Your primary station should
be added with `XCA` enabled and the hotline station should be added with `RX` enabled. Then configure the
hotline action with the primary and hotline station callsigns.

Once configured, pressing the action will toggle `TX` active between your primary and hotline frequencies.
A long press of the action will refresh the action's state.

## Configuring a TrackAudio status action

The TrackAudio status action shows the status of the connection between Stream Deck and TrackAudio, and whether
the voice connection in TrackAudio is up. A long press of the action will force a refresh of all the Stream Deck
TrackAudio actions.

## Configuring an ATIS letter action

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are actively controlling with [vATIS](https://vatis.app/) use the [vATIS actions for Stream Deck plugin](https://github.com/neilenns/streamdeck-vatis) instead to get
> real-time ATIS updates on your Stream Deck.
>
> For this action to work TrackAudio must be running and you must be connected for the ATIS letter to update.
> It can take five minutes or longer for the VATSIM data source to refresh and reflect the latest ATIS letter.

The ATIS letter action shows the current AITS letter for a station, refreshed automatically every minute.
When the ATIS letter updates the action will show an orange background until the action is pressed to reset the
state. A long press of the action will force a refresh of the ATIS information.

See the [SVG template documentation](https://github.com/neilenns/streamdeck-trackaudio/wiki/SVG-templates) for an example
template that shows the title small and station letter big.

### ATIS letter action settings <!-- omit from toc -->

## Configuring a main volume action

The main volume action displays the current volume of TrackAudio and enables changing the volume. This action requires a dial control, available on the [Stream Deck +](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-plus-black).

Turning the knob will adjust the station volume.

### Main volume settings <!-- omit from toc -->

| Setting       | Description                                                                                 | Default |

| Not connected | The image to display when not connected to TrackAudio. Optional, defaults to a volume icon. |         |

## SVG templates

All image properties support SVG templates using [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/). This enables using a single SVG image across multiple
actions, for example a single image to do custom display of ATIS letters with a station name. For more information on the available template
variables see the [documentation on the wiki](https://github.com/neilenns/streamdeck-trackaudio/wiki/SVG-templates).

## Examples

Here are some examples of different profiles people have created using these actions. Have an example you'd like to
share? [Open a new issue](https://github.com/neilenns/streamdeck-trackaudio/issues/new/choose) with a screenshot and
details of how you have the actions configured.

### Seattle tower

turn those stations off when it gets busy.
